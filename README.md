## 📖 Overview
The **Factory Product Inventory Management System** is a **menu-driven Python program** designed for small-scale inventory tracking.  
It uses a dictionary-based structure to store items, where each entry contains:

- **Stock** – number of available units  
- **Price** – per-unit price of the item  
- **Timestamp** – last updated date and time  

📊 Additionally, the project uses **Matplotlib** to generate **bar chart visualizations** of stock levels.
